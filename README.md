# Score Counter

This is a web application that I created using the React framework.

## Current Features

### Local Storage

The Score Counter application uses the windows local storage property to hold all player data on the device.


### Stats

With the ability to hold data, this application keeps basic stats in memory for created players.


### Saved Players

Score Counter can save all new players created from within the user interface.


### Game Parameters

Score Counter lets you decide what parameters are needed for a created game.

So far these parameters are:
 - Game Title
 - Max Rounds
 - Max Score
 
 ## Future Features
 
 - Ability to see all stats on a player card
 - Saved game templates
 - customizable player cards
